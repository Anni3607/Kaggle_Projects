Titanic Survival Prediction

 About
This notebook is my first Kaggle submission, where I explored the Titanic dataset using basic data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and applied Logistic Regression.

 Workflow
- Loaded and explored the training dataset
- Cleaned missing values in Age and Embarked
- Dropped irrelevant columns like Name and Ticket
- Used label encoding on Sex and Embarked
- Trained a Logistic Regression model and evaluated with accuracy and confusion matrix
- Made predictions on the test dataset and submitted

 Observations
- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate
- 1st class passengers had better survival chances
- Age had a slight influence on survival
