 Heart Disease Prediction 

This project is a ML classification model built to predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient data.

 What was done :

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Label Encoding of categorical values like 'Sex', 'Chest Pain Type'
- Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
- Model training using RandomForestClassifier
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Feature importance visualization



 Model Performance

- Accuracy: ~85%
- Most important features: `cp`, `thal`, `oldpeak`, `ca`, `chol`
