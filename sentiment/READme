Sentiment Analysis – Text Classification Project

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment behind a piece of text—classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral using traditional machine learning techniques.

 What the Project Does

The model takes raw input text and predicts the sentiment expressed. It's useful for applications like social media monitoring, product reviews, and customer feedback analysis.



How It Works

1. Text Preprocessing – Cleaning the text by converting to lowercase, removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.
2. Vectorization – Converting text into numerical form using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
3. Model Training – Training a classifier like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest.
4. Prediction – Classifying new input text into sentiment categories.
